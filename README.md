## **The Origins of Litecoin Cash Foundation**

The Litecoin Cash Foundation (LCF) was original founded by Sebastian Clarke, Iain Craig, and Michael Wyszynski, in London, December 2017.  Their original goal was to provide, as they call it, a "best of all worlds" cryptocurrency.  They carefully selected kry features from various other projects with optimizations in order to create a cheap, fast, and stable, general use blockchain.  They have since developed an innovative solution to the 51% Attack and partnered with OPUS12 to further utilize their blockchain.

## 2 Methods of Funding for Litecoin Cash Foundation
* In order to realize the initial monetray distribution, the Initial Fork Offering, or IFO, model was used and a mature, well-maintained donor ledger was choosen, Litecoin (LTC).
  * The IFO ratio was 10:1 for each holder of Litecoin at the LTC  block height of 1371111, the 18th of Febuary 18th, 2018   

* During the agent creation in the have menu of a full node wallet, there is a tick box to donate 10% of your "creation funds" to the community development fund.  This donation does not lessen the  agent creation so the vast majority of the community chooses to donte.

## **The Whitepages**
*While most project have a Whitepaper, LCF has 3 seperate whitepapers for each aspect of their project*

### <center>*Litecoin Cash (LCC)*
* The core cryptocurrency, forked from Litecoin and its Scrypt algorithim to back to the SHA256 that Litecoin forked from.  It is designed to be a fast, cheap method of exchanging value globally, and stable blockchain to build upon.  With a 2.5 minute block time, very low minimum transaction fee of 0.0001LTC, Dark Gravety Wave Difficulty adjustment, Segwit and Lightning network support.

### <center>*The Hive - Agent Based Mining*
* Agent-based mining enabling mining to be performed without the need for specialized equipment and fostering node distribution.  By purchasing agents "Bees" to mine block along side the PoW block it becomes virtually impossible to implement a 51% attack.  The purchasing requires the spending and subsequent "burning" of the LCC coin to reduce inflation, with an option to donate 10% to the community development fund at no loss to your purchase.  This process require the user to run and activly maintain a full node at all time while mining.  This help to signifigantly strengthen the network thru node distribution.

### <center>*OPUS 12 Global Partnership*
* Real world usecase for the LCC blockchain enabliing the creation of a "Secure ID" (SID) which in turn will act as a "Secure Key" to access other downstream blockchain-based application such as "Academic Activity Logger" (AAL) and "Credentialing Document Repository" (CDR).  These programs will allow for the globally, verifiable tracking of acheivements in the medical field as well as creating "Basic Electronic Medical Records" (BEMR).

## **The Cryptocurrency Landscape**
The world of FinTech and crypto curriency in perticular is new and in its infancy so innovations are fast, abundunt, and in some cases monumental. 

While all crypto projects facilitate safe, verifiable digital payments systems, not all projects are the same.  These are some of the most notable projects and their contributions to the crypto ecosystem.

* **Bitcoin**
  * The most recognized and the pioneer of crypto curriencies.  Bitcoins original wallet is still forked by over 90% of all new projects to this day.

* **Ethereum**
  * Ethereum was the first project to introduce the idea of Smart Contrat, and Dapps.  This allowed for hundreds of projects to launch ontop of the Ethereum blockchain without having to develop and deploy their own blockchain.

* **ZCash**
  * ZCash (Eletric Coin Company) was the first to introduce ZKsnarks, a method of privacy allowing for sheilded addresses preventing the world from knowing exactly what your wallets balance it while maintaining the overall concensus.

* **Dash**
  * Dash introduced the masternode system, a method of rewarding node who are willing to lock funds for a period of time, maintain the node 24/7 and in return recieve small payments like interest.  They also were the first to introduce Dark Gravity Wave, a method of automatically adjusting the mining algorighim based on the overall network hashrate at any given time.  Dark Gravity Wave is one of the most widely used difficulty adjustment methods.

* **Ripple**
  * Ripple (Company name) djklfhdsfkjha

## **Results, How do we gauge the success of a crypto project?**
### *With over 2000 projects on 60 different algorithims what defines success...*

* **Price** – The obvious metric but in an unregulated market filled with pump groups FUD and FOMO its not very accurate.

* **Market Cap** – This only really measures the value of a project not its success.  Any Bank or govt could release a ‘cheap, fast coin but it would be centralized, controlled, perhaps even censored…. “Transaction Unapproved” None the less it would gain steam because they have the funding to make it happen, and ultimately would topple Bitcoin in Market Cap…Look at Ripple (XRP)  But does that make it a Successful crypto currency?

* **Mainstream Acceptance** – Is there a real world use for the coin, if its cash can I spend it anywhere? How many transactions are occurring each day, and how many places accept it as payment for either services or goods?


* **Transaction Speed** - Transactions need to be fast inorder to facilitate the thousands of transactions some retailers perform daily.  No one wants to wait 3-5 minutes in line to pay for their grocery

* **Trading Volume** - In cryptos trade volume is often times "faked" or otherwise manipulated.  In an article by CoinDesk, "Bitwise Asset Management, one of several U.S. firms seeking regulatory approval to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), has estimated that 95 percent of bitcoin trading volumes are faked..." [(CoinDesk)](https://www.coindesk.com/for-15k-hell-fake-your-exchange-volume-youll-get-on-coinmarketcap) 

* **Number of Txn's Per Day** - A simple metric to see overall usage

Some "Die Hard" Enthusiasts Measure of Success of a Cryptocurrency solely based on the principles in Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin Whitepapers:
>**Abstract.** <br> A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of
hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing
the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of
events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As
long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to
attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The
network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort
basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest
proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.
<br><h3>**1. Introduction**</h3><br>
Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as
trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for
most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.
Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot
avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the
minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions,
and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads...no mechanism exists to make payments
over a communications channel without a trusted party.
What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,
allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted
third party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers
from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. In
this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed
timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The
system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any
cooperating group of attacker nodes.[(Satoshi's Whitepaper)](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

  * **Decentralization** – The more nodes the better

  * **Transparency**  – Visibility of the blockchain and its transactions. Anyone can contribute, all open source work on Github (Although Microsoft is now restricting access to Github for sanctioned countries)

  * **Borderless** – Can be acquired, anywhere in the world by anyone in the world. (as long as you have internet, but with SkyNet and OneWeb on the way soon everyone everywhere will have internet access.)

  * **Trustless** – no 3rd party to interact with your transaction.  Transactions are, in their simplest form, direct from wallet to wallet, from peer to peer.

There is currently no one size fits all set of metrics to determine the success of a crypto project but these are some of the data points we have found for the Top 5 coins.

## Recommendations
### *What should the future hold for Litecoin Cash and Litecoin Cash Foundation?*

**Mobile Wallet with Auto Exchange**
* Users need a method of accessing their LCC at anytime, any place in the world they have mobile web access.  Moreover they need the ability to automatically exchange their LCC into native fiat or any other currency their merchant may accept. 

**Credit Card Services**
* Partnering with the major credit card companies (MC, Amex, Disc, Visa) would enable access to ten of millions of merchants, world wide, instantly.
* With this partnership comes the ability to facilite ATM withdrawls giving users the ability to withdraw LCC into local fiat currency to fill the gap where digital payments are not avalible.

The ability to send and recieve LCC at anytime with anyone globally, and to be able to spend it like native fiat anywhere that accepts credit card or digital payments including, ATM withdrawls for physical fiat, would stimulate mass adoption without the need to setup new infrastructure.  Eventually mercahants will rather save the fees on fiat conversions for their own purchaes including stock orders, utilities, ect and begin accepting LCC in its native form.  

In a Medium article blogger Lambo borrows an analogy from crypto influnecer Andreas Antonopoulos, who asks:
> "Do you know what an operating system is? <br> Of course you do! You run Windows on your desktop and iOS on your iPhone.
But have you ever heard of Linux? <br>You might have. You’d probably even know that it is an operating system. You might even say something like this: it is not as popular as Windows, Android, or iOS; it is used mostly by nerds and hackers. Of course, some of you may know better.<br>
The truth is all of us use Linux every single day and we don’t even know it. It is used in your phones, vacuum cleaners, cars, elevators, and every single web server you touch. Majority of the world devices runs on Linux from the smallest micro devices to the supercomputers to the Large Hadron Collider...Android is nothing but a modified Linux combined with a few other open source software just like Linux...Today, the average person cannot tell how successful Linux is because they have no clue how their devices work. But, if you become a CEO of a small company that plans to build, say, a smart watch product; you’ll come to realize that instead of inventing the entire system, you can simply adopt or modify an existing Linux system for free...Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like it, will likely be the Linux of not only our financial system, but to every other system that requires trust."
